# Pomodoro timer for command line interface

A python script to have a [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer in the command line interface (terminal).
This timer is handy if you are trying to apply the pomodoro technique in your study sessions.
I have been using it personally to keep track of time in my own study sessions.

Note: I've never tested this on windows, only on macOS.
